A big circle instead
The arrows are pointed to each image
Should be placed left side of the page (and enlarge it)
Use the triangle symbol for the water drop for the TOCEANS Mission
You need to find a better heard shaped online
Remove <TOCREANS> Vision

Purpose and WHY
Put them in the frame! (Use the frame he provided -- from Mary)
